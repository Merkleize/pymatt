##Vault

Implements a vault similar to the one described in [this bitcoin-dev post](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2023-April/021588.html).

Run the demo with:

```console
$ python vault.py
```

`vault.py` is a command line tool that allows to create, manage and spend the Vault UTXOs.
